BT Fair Billing Technical Assessment
====================================

Compile using: 

	mvn clean package
	
Run from the project root using:

    java -jar target/fairbilling-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.fairbilling.FairBilling
    
A sample file test.log is in the project root.    	
      
Note: Command-line tested on Git Bash on Windows, as I don't have an Ubuntu
      distro set up at the moment.

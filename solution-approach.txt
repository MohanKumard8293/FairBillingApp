Fair billing :
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hosted application provider which charges for the use of its application by the duration of sessions 
with the Session users (whether this is the start or end of the session, like given below).

The usage data comes from a log file that lists the time at which a session starts or stops (in the 
format HH:MM:SS), the name of the user (which is a single alphanumeric string, of arbitrary length) 
and whether this is the start or end of the session, like this:

14:02:03 ALICE99 Start
14:02:05 CHARLIE End
14:02:34 ALICE99 End
14:02:58 ALICE99 Start
14:03:02 CHARLIE Start
14:03:33 ALICE99 Start
14:03:35 ALICE99 End
14:03:37 CHARLIE End
14:04:05 ALICE99 End
14:04:23 ALICE99 End
14:04:41 CHARLIE Start


Step 1: To Calculate total session Users time spent: The total number of sessions, and total 
duration of their sessions in seconds.


Step 2: A user can also have more than one session active concurrently. 
Where there is an “End” with no possible matching start, the start time should be assumed to be the 
earliest time of any record in the file. Where there is a “Start” with no possible matching “End”, 
the end time should be assumed to be the latest time of any record in the file. 

First example:-
---------------
So, for a file containing only these records:

14:02:03 ALICE99 Start
14:02:05 CHARLIE End
14:02:34 ALICE99 End

The start time for CHARLIE's record should be assumed to be the earliest time in the file, 
i.e. 14:02:03. Similarly for the first example above.

Second example:-
----------------
So, for a file containing only these records:

14:04:05 ALICE99 End
14:04:23 ALICE99 End
14:04:41 CHARLIE Start

The last record is a “Start” and there are no later records at all so CHARLIE's last session will be 
considered to have finished at 14:04:41, i.e. it will be 0 seconds in duration.


Step 3: Putting all together, the results for the original data shown above would be as follows 
(name, sessions and total time).

ALICE99 4 240
CHARLIE 3 37

Note: There may be other invalid or irrelevant data within the file.
Therefore, any lines that do not contain a valid time-stamp, username and a Start or End marker should 
be silently ignored and not included in any calculations.
